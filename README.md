This program checks if a credit card number is valid and tells you if it's a Visa or Mastercard.

For Visa:

It should start with a '4'.
After that, there should be 12 more numbers.
Optionally, there can be 3 more numbers at the end.
For Mastercard:

It should start with a '5' followed by a number between 1 and 5.
After that, there should be 14 more numbers.
If the number fits these rules, the program says it's a valid Visa or Mastercard. If not, it says it's an unknown card type or an invalid number.
